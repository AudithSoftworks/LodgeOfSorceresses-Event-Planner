SOVNGARDE OVERVIEW, HISTORY

In 2016, Studio Kasumi began development of Sovngarde to provide the Skyrim modding community with a beautiful, free font for their creations. Since then, over half a million users have used the font replacement mod on PC & Xbox. It's also been used in thousands of videos, livestreams and even featured in blogs.

It supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Polish, German and Russian along with two unique font weights (bold and light).

The purpose of this typeface has always been to bring people together even across language boundaries, so it's totally free for anyone to modify, share and redistribute with credit outside uses for monetary gain or commercialization. Read the included license for more details.
