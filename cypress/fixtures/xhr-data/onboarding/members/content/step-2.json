Players joining our guild need to understand and be able to fulfill them:\n<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWe only accept\u00a0<strong>CP 160+ players<\/strong>\u00a0to our guild. If you haven't reached this Champion rank, please do not apply.<br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWe expect in average <b>minimum 3-4 evenings\/week availability<\/b>\u00a0from our members. Please do not apply if you barely can login once or twice a week. Players who work in shifts and might not be around every two or three weeks are welcome to apply - we've had such active members in our guild and as such, we try to be inclusive towards them, as long as they are willing to be online as much as possible.<br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWe are interested only in\u00a0<strong>fresh and motivated player-base<\/strong>. Those who are burnt out from the game and are rather aggressively interested only in certain type of content (e.g. vCR+3 progression only, or certain achievement progression only etc), shouldn't apply to our guild. We need\u00a0<strong>long-term members<\/strong>\u00a0who are rather energetic and motivated about playing the game.<br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Every guild member has to have 100% game content access, i.e. having access to all DLCs<\/strong>. This rule also covers the latest <strong>content expansions<\/strong> (Greymoor, as of this writing) after 6 months of their release date\u00a0<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">(i.e. our members are free to postpone purchasing it until\u00a06 months after it is released; in current example, the ownership of Greymoor will be mandatory after Dec 26th of this year.\u00a0This exception isn't usual for our guild to have, but considering the current world we live in, with COVID-19 and its effects on all of us, Lodge decided to make it one - a temporary exception which is a reasonable thing to do)<\/span>.<br>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\tPlease do not apply to the guild if you don't and\/or can't meet this requirement. Generally having the latest expansion pack (once it is 6+ months old) along with ESO+ subscription does the trick. Having all DLCs purchased via Crown Store is also a possible alternative to ESO+.<br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Attendance requirement of 2-content-a-week activity routine.<\/strong>\u00a0In a nutshell, every guild member\u00a0<em>wishing to get Tier-level clearance<\/em>\u00a0(and thus be eligible for high-end group content participation) need to do 2 content every week (of Midgame and\/or Endgame type), in a regular fashion. For Core members this requirement happens automatically, since they do 3-day-a-week raiding. For a non-Core members any 2\u00a0Midgame (DLC vDungeons &amp; vArenas) or Endgame (open-vTrials) content done within a week does the trick. Doing these 2 content doesn't need to be in different days: one can do all of them within a single day. Additionally, in future, during Core-building, the members with the best Attendance track record will be preferred the most. So please try to be as active as possible. The more content we do with guildies, the better our future raiders will have a chance to train and improve (especially fresh players).<br>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\tAttendance requirement is tracked automatically by our bot <a contenteditable=\"false\" data-ipshover=\"\" data-ipshover-target=\"https:\/\/lodgeofsorceresses.com\/profile\/2533-dandelion\/?do=hovercard\" data-mentionid=\"2533\" href=\"https:\/\/lodgeofsorceresses.com\/profile\/2533-dandelion\/\" id=\"ips_uid_727_16\" rel=\"\">@Dandelion<\/a>, via our Discord server and Guild Planner. You can see your Attendance record in your User Profile on the Planner.<br>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><strong>Important:<\/strong> As of August 1st, 2020, Attendance requirement has stopped being mandatory in Lodge of Sorceresses. However, when we form an Endgame Core group, active members with good Attendance track record will have higher priority compared to those of the same skill level, but with relatively lower or no Attendance performance. All in all, joining Lodge doesn't require upholding weekly 2-content-a-week Attendance anymore.<\/span><br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Absence (being offline) for more than a week\u00a0without notification<\/strong>\u00a0will result in guild kick. If you plan to be away for an extended period of time, please inform the guild leader.<br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>\n\tAfter 3-4 months of membership, we grant our members<em>\u00a0<\/em>a meta-rank of\u00a0<strong>Adeptus Exemptus<\/strong>\u00a0which exempts them from any guild requirements. With this rank, an exempted member cannot be kicked due to not meeting requirements, or even for not playing the game. We consider\u00a0<em>Adeptus Exemptus<\/em>\u00a0as our old members, as part of our guild's legacy.\n<\/p>\n",
