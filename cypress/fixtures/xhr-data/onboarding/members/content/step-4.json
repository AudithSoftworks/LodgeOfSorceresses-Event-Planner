And to make sure our teams train sufficiently before they reach tough content, we've put certain Tier-system in Core progression similar to our regular <a href=\"https:\/\/lodgeofsorceresses.com\/topic\/5741-pve-content-clearance-guide\/\" rel=\"\">Content Clearance Tier-system<\/a>. A Core progresses through the same content Tiers listed there. Following bullet-points are of great importance:\n\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\tCore progression only involves DLC vTrials, as long as the majority of the team have already cleared Craglorn HMs multiple times over before;\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tCore moves to the next piece of content once the team\u00a0have achieved all necessary achievements for the whole group;\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tWhile progressing in Tier-2 content, Core moves to the next instance once the team have achieved minimum 20 (out of total 36)\u00a0vitality clearance of the instance;\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tWhile progressing in Tier-3 content, Core moves to the next instance once the team have achieved minimum 10 (out of total 36)\u00a0vitality clearance of the instance;\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tWhile progressing in Tier-4 content, there is no minimum vitality-based clearance requirement for the instances.\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\tAs such, it is required of all Core raiders to be aware of this Tier-based Core Progression and be able to commit to it.\n<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\t<b>Attendance<\/b>: Core membership requires 3-day-a-week raiding on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, from 8:30pm\u00a0to 11pm, CE(S)T. For the emergencies in life and the unexpected at work, a raider can miss up to 2 (two) raids in a monthly basis. More than that, the raider in question might get replaced\/removed from Core without notice.<br><br>\n\t\tRaider needs to be online, out of groups, with consumables ready, 15 minutes prior the raid - by 8:15pm CE(S)T. Raids shouldn't last past 11pm, and if they do, raider is allowed to leave at his\/her own discretion. Otherwise, raider cannot leave the raid before time.<br><br><span style=\"color:null\">If you think you can't attend certain event - whether\u00a0it's due to emergency or not -\u00a0please notify your Raid Leader at least 1 hour prior the event,\u00a0stating the situation.<br><br><em>Backups<\/em>\u00a0(also known as\u00a0<em>sitouts<\/em>) are to be online and available to a summon during the whole raid\u00a0event. They can engage in any content they want, but at the same time, they need to be summonable in a minute's notice, if a need for them arises. Backup not being online and available will be considered as\u00a0absent\u00a0for that day.<\/span><br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>Requirements<\/strong>: Raiders need to have the following\u00a0<em>add-on-installation\/game-setup:<\/em><\/span>\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.esoui.com\/downloads\/info1355-RaidNotifierUpdated.html\" rel=\"external nofollow\">RaidNotifier Updated<\/a>\u00a0needs to be installed, and bosses activated (in addon settings).<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.esoui.com\/downloads\/info2311-HodorReflexes-DPSUltimateShare.html\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Hodor Reflexes<\/a>\u00a0installed and DPS sharing activated (in addon settings).<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color:null\">In-game,\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Combat &gt; Encounter Logs &gt; Appear Anonymously<\/em>\u00a0needs to be set to OFF.<\/span><br>\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>Be In Shape!<\/strong>\u00a0Players can't join events in heavily intoxicated\u00a0(drunken, high or similar) state, as it damages team progression. If this becomes the case, raid leader reserves the right to remove such player from group.<\/span><br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>Raid-Eligible Characters Only!<\/strong>\u00a0Event attendance is content-clearance based. Players can't bring a character with\u00a0insufficient clearance to any content.<\/span>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>During Raids<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>Leaders<\/strong>: Raiders must listen to directives of a Raid Leader (there always will be only\u00a0<strong>one<\/strong>\u00a0Raid Leader only, whereas guild overall may have more than one)\u00a0and be constructive with their comments. Being overly offensive and intolerant will not be tolerated! Not listening to commands, disregarding them, disagreeing with them in a destructive manner\u00a0<em>during events<\/em>\u00a0will not be tolerated either: if you have something to add, something to \"fix\", please do that with courtesy - use suitable moments in between pulls. If Raid Leader disagrees, keep it to\u00a0<em>after the event<\/em>!<\/span><br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>Rage Quitting Strictly Forbidden!<\/strong>\u00a0Players rage-quitting the raid, will be removed from our Raid Core immediately without further notification. Such players might also be removed from the guild altogether, in guild leader's discretion.<\/span><br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>Be Vigil!<\/strong>\u00a0Players need to be attentive and alert during raid time: newbie behavior such as continuous ninja pulling, randomly idling and distracting others during difficult content are not the features we seek in potential raiders. In such cases, Raid Leader reserves the right to replace offending raiders. Continuous violation of this rule might result in removal from the guild, at guild leader's discretion.<\/span><br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span style=\"color:null\"><strong>Voice-over-IP Etiquette<\/strong>: Players are not to dominate the voice server (Discord), especially giving orders around, and\/or trying to change the flow of raid tactics unless assigned to do so. If someone have\u00a0something to add or suggest regarding tactics, they are welcome to share it at a suitable moment when it's being explained, or while resurrecting and getting ready for a new pull.<\/span><br><br>\n\t\tAdditionally, bashing raiders for failures is <strong>strictly<\/strong> forbidden. If you feel that it is keeping us from progress, explain them what and how they could do better in private chat, nicely.\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
