And this encompasses not only <em>participation<\/em>, but also <strong>organization<\/strong>\u00a0side of things. This means, by design, open-events realized on our Discord server through Open Initiative\u00a0can also be organized by\u00a0<em>Soulshriven<\/em> authorized by us and tagged as regular organizers (\"Lieutenants\").\u00a0If you are interested in\u00a0regularly planning, organizing\u00a0and leading such events, please let us know.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Open Events Organization Guidelines<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn time, we devised following Guidelines to help us govern the way open-events (i.e. open vTrials) are organized. These events generally\u00a0are of <strong>three<\/strong> types:\u00a0<em>progression, farm and score raids<\/em>, and we will be handling them separately:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Open Progression Raids<\/em> generally don't require prior clearing of the\u00a0content in any way, unless the Raid is a HM\u00a0of main content (e.g. vCR+1 is considered an HM of vCR+0, the same way vAA HM is that of regular vAA\u00a0etc).<br><br>\n\t\tIn the case of being a non-HM\u00a0(e.g. vCR+0, vAS+0, non-HM vTrials), the related event announcements <strong><em>cannot have<\/em><\/strong> any \"<em>must have finished<\/em>\", \"<em>must have cleared before<\/em>\" or similar statements in them.<br><br>\n\t\tIn the case of being an HM, prior main-raid content clearing <strong><em>maybe<\/em><\/strong> and <em><strong>should<\/strong> be<\/em>\u00a0stated as a requirement (again, for example, if content is vAA HM, prior clearance of vAA may be, or even, should be, required).<br><br>\n\t\tIn contrary, <em>Open Farm and Score Raids<\/em>\u00a0<strong>do<\/strong>\u00a0require prior clearance of the content.<br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<em>Open Progression\u00a0Raids<\/em> can require people to read and learn mechanics from guides. They need to explicitly state that, if this is the case. <em>Open Farm and Score Runs<\/em> on the other hand, already assume you know the mechanics.<br>\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAll Open Raids, as any content we organize, are <a href=\"https:\/\/lodgeofsorceresses.com\/topic\/5741-pve-content-clearance-guide\/\" rel=\"\">Tier-based<\/a>.\u00a0<em>Open Progression &amp; Farm Raids<\/em> require the character doing them to have minimum the same Tier-clearance as the content is. E.g. vMOL is Tier-2\u00a0content, so only characters with Tier-2 (<span style=\"color:#3498db;\">Practicus<\/span>) clearance can attend those.<br><br>\n\t\tFor <em>Open Score Runs<\/em> though, the Tier-level requirement is 1 (one)\u00a0level above of the content. E.g. when a Tier-2 content (e.g. vMOL) is organized as a Score run, only Tier-3\u00a0and above characters may attend it. Announcements should mention roles in accordance to this.\u00a0\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\tShort - <em>tl:dr<\/em>\u00a0version:\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t<em>Progression Runs<\/em>: same Tier requirement as the content itself, no prior experience required for non-HMs.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t<em>Farm Runs<\/em>: same Tier requirement as the content itself, prior experience required for both non-HMs and HMs.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t<em>Score Runs<\/em>: one Tier above requirement than the content itself, prior experience and good knowledge of mechanics are required.<br>\n\t\u00a0\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\tOrganizers, please make sure your announcements follow these guidelines.\n<\/p>\n",
